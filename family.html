            <p>I am the second child of three siblings. My mother and father are my source of strength and inspiration that Allah SWT has given to me in my life journey to grow and become better. We lived in Kluang, Johor since my father was sent here while in service until he retired from the Malaysian Armed Forces. In my family, I am very inspired by my mother and father who taught me not to give up quickly and to always look for solutions. As my father said, "there is nothing that cannot be done."</p>
